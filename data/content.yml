      body: |
        As a member of the R&D team at Smartesting, I worked during one and a half year on [Zest testing](http://www.zest-testing.com), a collaborative web application for tests scenarios writing.
        I worked on every parts of the application: frontend with Ember.js, backend with Ruby on Rails and sysadmin tasks with Puppet.
        
        I have been the main developer of [zest-publisher](https://github.com/Smartesting/zest-publisher), the tool converting tests scenarios from Zest to executable tests.
        
        I was also the main developer of some features in the application:
        
         - background tasks running
         - scenario and actionword editor
         - scenario datatable editor
         - refactoring (renaming, extracting and inlining actionwords)
         - creating and setting up [_zest-publisher as a service_](https://zest-publisher.smartesting.com/), a web application to ease usage of Zest publisher
         - advanced search based on Elastic search
        
        I also activelly pushed open sourcing of code produced at Smartesting (zest-publisher, [Ember easy datatable](https://github.com/Smartesting/ember-easy-datatable.js), [Scalability test](https://github.com/Smartesting/scalability_test))

      title: "Web developer(Plone, Django)"
      body: |
        For more than one year, I have been product manager and main developer of [Prettig Personeel](http://www.prettigpersoneel.nl), an online HR management tool.
        My role was to develop new feature, refactor existing code and handling releasing and deployment of the tool.
        
        I was also responsible of the development of [Oldtimers Verzeken](http://www.oldtimers-verzekeren.nl), a website for old vehicle insurances. At this occasion, I created Zest MicroCMS, a Django based CMS dedicated for website for which Plone is oversized.
        
        I also worked on various other websites based on Plone CMS. On [Lilly Medical](http://www.lillymedical.com), I worked on iPad compatibility and various other Javascript tasks.
        For [Minaraad](http://www.minaraad.be) (a website for handling inter commissions projects for the belgian governement), I created the projects management system.
        
        Zest was sometimes contacted by customers for updating existing websites. I worked for [VJ Movement](http://www.vjmovement.com) for bugfixes, integrating the new theme and integrate the interactive comics on the comic dedicated website [Cartoon Movement](http://www.cartoonmovement.com).
        I also worked don the update of the website [Den Haag Ontmoetding](http://www.denhaagontmoetdenhaag.nl) (a website to manage inter-school projects in The Hague region) and various bugfixes.
        I created the third version of the [Franel](http://www.franel.eu) website (a European project for Dutch and French learning). This site relies on a web service containing all data (users, lessons, results...) and a local MySQL database for cahing data and avoid overload of the web service.
        I was assigned to those site as I was generally responsible for the development of Django powered websites at Zest. I was also assigned to Javascript related tasks.

      title: "Compuer science Ph. D (Web service validation using model based tests generation)"
      body: |
        The goal of my Ph. D was to use model based testing with web services. My researches led to the creation of iTaC-QoS, a fully automatic validation framework based on UDDI (a yellow pages system for web services) and UML.  
        
        I produced several tools and methods during this Ph. D:
          - validation process used in iTaC-QoS.
          - automated creation of UML skeleton from WSDL specifications.
          - guidelines for efficient UML modeling of web services.
          - automated discovery of dependencies between web services operations.
          - automated translation of abstract tests into executable tests.
          - automated generation of code for test’s verdict computing from OCL specifications. This code determines if a bug is critical when a test fails.
          - distributed test bench handling the correct ordering of tests execution.
        
        Four articles about my researches have been published in international conferences and workshops. One of them has been published as an extended version in an internatiobal journal.
        
        As a Ph.D student, I also assumed teaching responsabilities and student projects managment.

        During my master, I studied the impact of multi-agent and components paradigms for video transmission.
        
        My researchs conducted to the creation of a video transmission framework able to adapt video on the fly to handle network congestion, load balancing and habilities of the receiver.

        At Bleu-Vert, I worked on two web sites:
        
        - [Tschau](http://www.tschau.ch): bugs correction and new functionalities development.
        - [Guide Social](http://www.guidesocial.ch): administration interface development.
        
        I developed those sites with PHP and MySQL. I used the Smarty template system to split code and design parts. I closely worked with a web designer who was creating design while I was focusing on business functionalities.
